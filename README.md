# Hand Gesture Music Player: A Happy Birthday Tune ðŸŽµâœ‹

Play the classic "Happy Birthday" tune using hand gestures! This Python project leverages the power of the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and couples it with musical notes generated using Pygame. As the user shows their hand to the webcam, the program sequentially plays each note of the "Happy Birthday" song.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture tracking using MediaPipe.
- Musical notes generation using the Pygame library.
- Seamless integration of video feed and sound for an interactive experience.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV: For video capture and processing.
- Pygame: For generating and playing musical notes.
- MediaPipe: For real-time hand tracking.
- NumPy: For mathematical operations.

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pygame mediapipe numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Navigate to the directory and run:
```bash
python main-code.py
```
3. Display your hand in front of the webcam. The program will start playing the "Happy Birthday" tune.
4. To exit, press 'q'.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more songs and tunes.
- Mapping specific gestures to specific notes for a more interactive experience.
- Adding a GUI for song selection and volume control.
